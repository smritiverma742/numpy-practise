# NumPy Practice Notebook – Phase 3

This repository contains my NumPy practice notebook: `phase-3.ipynb`. It includes step-by-step code examples and explanations of essential NumPy operations.

## What's Inside

The notebook covers:

- Finding matching elements between two arrays
- Swapping columns and rows in 2D arrays
- Reversing rows and columns
- Creating arrays with random numbers in a specific range
- Formatting arrays for better readability (decimal precision, disabling scientific notation)
- Vectorizing scalar functions to work with arrays
- Filtering arrays by a given range
- And other frequently used NumPy techniques

Each code block includes a clear explanation to help reinforce the underlying logic and NumPy syntax.

## Why I Created This

I created this notebook as part of my personal learning to strengthen my understanding of NumPy — an essential library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It's designed to be a quick reference and revision guide for myself and others learning NumPy.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `phase-3.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code
3. Run the cells to see how each example works
4. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding

## Tools Used
